1. Read through the beginning half of PAYS curriculum and took notes in a google doc. 
2.  Finish reading through the rest and take notes on the structure of problems. 
3. I'm still a little confused about the physical logistics of computers in the classroom. It looks like the students mostly work in groups already, so maybe shared devices with a server connection would work, so every student doesn't need to download on their own device?

1. Continued Reading through Pays curriculum. Created an infographic for teaching the difference between Quantitative and Categorical variables. Re-wrote a few problems what used excel in r. 
2. Find more problems that cant be shifted from excel to r usage. 
3. How is material typically taught during the program. Is it similar to a college lecture with slideshow presentation? I wanted to start thinking about teaching materials for information but i realized i not sure how material is usually taught.

1. Re wrote section 5.2 in Latex and a Quarto document. Marked down and started writing example questions that involved excel usage. 
2. Discuss whether I should try to continue in Latex or if it would be beneficial to switch to quarto. 
3. Same as question 2 but I'm not sure how easy it is to view images in Latex, which makes it difficult to explain certain topics. Its much clearer in a quarto doc, but have to deal with problems of combining work with current curriculum.
