1. Read through the beginning half of PAYS curriculum and took notes in a google doc. 
2.  Finish reading through the rest and take notes on the structure of problems. 
3. I'm still a little confused about the physical logistics of computers in the classroom. It looks like the students mostly work in groups already, so maybe shared devices with a server connection would work, so every student doesn't need to download on their own device?
