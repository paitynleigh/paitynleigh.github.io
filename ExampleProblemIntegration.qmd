## 5.2: Using R for Scientific Calculations

#### 1. Data Entry

**blurb about entering data
assigning variable names
quotations around character/categorical
leave certain blank or give information in a paragraph and have students fill in code

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

animal <- c("Dog", "Cat", "Hamster", "Snail")
distance <- c(20,10,3,.1)
time <- c(2.5,.8,.6,10)

data_frame <- data.frame(Animal = animal, Distance = distance, Time = time)

data_frame
```

#### Doing Caluculations

introduce basic tidyverse functions
understanding the use of variables for calculation
explain use of mutate
naming new variable setting equal to its value
pipe operator and assigning name to data frame

```{r}

new_data <- data_frame |>
  mutate(speed = Distance / Time)

new_data
```

#### Basic Graphing

#### Curve Fitting
